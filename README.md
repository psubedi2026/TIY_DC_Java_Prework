# TIY_DC_Java_Prework

Working with Git will be a huge part of this class. Familiarity with it is going to be a requirement almost anywhere you end up working. Its purpose is to store "snapshots" (called commits) of your code, so you can see your progress and revert your changes if necessary. It also makes it easy to push your changes to a server, which acts as a backup of your code and a way to collaborate with other programmers.


###Computer Setup

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All students must bring their own MacBook laptop. Your MacBook should have a minimum of 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of hard drive space. Those are minimum specs, but I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend getting 8 GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Here are the current <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html">MacBook Air models</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-retina/">MacBook Pro models</a>. Your MacBook MUST be running macOS <strong>Sierra</strong> which is a free upgrade from the mac AppStore.</p>

<p>Do not go with the new, skinny 12” Retina MacBooks. Their processor will be too sluggish in a year or two.</p>

<h3 id="operating-system">Operating System</h3>

<p>You’ll need to install macOS Sierra if your Mac didn’t have it pre-installed or you haven’t upgraded already.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the macOS Sierra upgrade from the Apple Store: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-sierra/id1127487414?mt=12">download here</a>.</li>
  <li>You’ll need to sign in to your Mac’s ‘App Store’ with your <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/">Apple ID</a>.</li>
  <li>Double-click “Install macOS Sierra” to begin installation.<br>
<em>WARNING</em>: The macOS upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note: macOS Sierra is still relatively new. If you are on El Capitan, the last major version, then you should be fine.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="additional-software">Additional Software</h3>


<h4 id="install-google-chrome">Install IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (30 day trial)</h4>

<p>We will issue a free euducational license to continue to use the IDE as a student.  Contact instructor for further information</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition"> the IntelliJ IDEA download page</a>.</li>
  <li>click on DMG file to isntall it</li>

<h4 id="install-google-chrome">Install Google Chrome</h4>

<p>While the end users of our applications will use a variety of browsers, I have found that Google Chrome is currently the best option for developing (and testing) our front end applications.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download Chrome from <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">the Chrome download page</a>.</li>
  <li>Install and run it.</li>
  <li>Optionally, you may want to set Chrome as your <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en">default browser</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="install-iterm2">Install iTerm2</h4>

<p>The terminal is our text-based interface into the computer. It is much more powerful than graphical user interfaces (GUI’s) generally and will be more efficient for us in the long run. MacOS comes with a terminal built in, but many people prefer a program called iTerm2.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download iTerm2 from <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html">the iTerm2 website</a></li>
  <li>Unzip the downloaded file by double-clicking on it.</li>
  <li>Open your Applications directory by clicking on the Finder and selecting it from the left sidebar.</li>
  <li>Drag the unzipped iTerm application into the Applications folder.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="install-homebrew">Install Homebrew</h4>

<p>Homebrew will make it easier for us to install other applications we will need during class.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open up the iTerm2 application you installed previously.</li>
  <li>Go to this site: http://brew.sh/ and copy &amp; paste the install command into your terminal (it should be the first thing on that page(</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="install-git">Install git</h4>

<li>Open up the iTerm2 application</li>
  <li>Run:<br>
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install git</code></li>
  <li>Run:<br>
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">git --version</code> to see that you have it installed (you should see a version number print out)</li>
  <li>Run:<br>
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">git config --global push.default simple</code></li>
  <li>Run:<br>
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain</code></li>
</ol>

### Class Policies

Your new career starts now. Literally. You're not in school, you're doing your job. As such, I expect you to be professional in every respect. This includes:

 * Show up to work.
 * Show up to work on time.
 * Complete your work on time and to the best of your abilities.
 * Be proactive when challenges arise.
 * Treat each other and yourself with respect.

The following is reiterated from the "Student Bulletin" document. These are all part of the agreement that you signed with The Iron Yard when you enrolled:

**Don't Miss Class** - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. Don't miss any classes, if you can at all help it. We will be moving very fast, missing even a single class can be catastrophic! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

**Do Your Work** - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the day of its deadline. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

**Be Honorable** - You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code will not only render your homework unacceptable but will also prevent you from learning the material (and often from writing code that works). Copying homework can result in forfeiting career support.

**Treat Yourself and Others With Respect** - [Read and live the code of conduct.](https://online.theironyard.com/library/paths/44/units/94/lessons/437) I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally speaking, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Have an issue with someone? If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, as we genuinely care for the well-being of our students.
